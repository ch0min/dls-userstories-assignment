## Project Board Usage

### Issue Management Procedure

The team will manage tasks and features through a structured process using the project board. Below is a breakdown of the procedure:

### Labels
Each issue will be tagged with relevant labels for easy categorization:
- **help wanted**: If you are stuck and need help.
- **question**: If you have a question or clarification about a task.
- **documentation**: For changes or additions to project documentation.
- **priority**: To indicate the urgency of the task (e.g., `high`, `medium`, `low`).

### Estimation
Each issue will have a time estimate assigned, helping the team gauge how long tasks are expected to take. Estimates will be recorded in hours or days and labeled accordingly.

- Example: 
  - `estimate: 2h`
  - `estimate: 1d`

### Issue Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Team members can create issues by clearly describing the problem or feature request, adding relevant labels, and assigning an estimated time.
2. **Assignment**: Issues will be assigned to team members based on availability and expertise.
3. **Progress**: Issues will be moved through the board as they progress (`Backlog` → `In Progress` → `Review` → `Testing` → `Done`).
4. **Completion**: Upon resolving the issue, it will be marked as `Done`, and the pull request will be reviewed by another team member.
   
### Responsibilities
- **Issue Assignment**: The project lead will assign issues during sprint planning as necessary.
- **Team Collaboration**: Each team member is responsible for regularly updating the status of the issues they are assigned and keeping track of time estimates.
